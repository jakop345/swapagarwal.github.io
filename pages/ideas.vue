        <h2>I üßû wish there existed:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                A chrome extension to limit infinite scroll on social media to reduce content addiction!
            </li>
            <li>
                A gym that increases your monthly fee based on how frequently you go.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cosplay for hospitals; we need more of that!
            </li>
            <li>
                Generic caching proxy as a service (for using as a wrapper over rate-limited APIs).
            </li>
        </ul>
        If you end up making one of the above or know that it exists already, do let me know! I'll be quite thankful. üôè
