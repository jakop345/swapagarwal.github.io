    <div class="about">
        My Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is INFP.
        <br><br>
        I'm a polyglot who lives by the philosophy "Don't reinvent the wheel" and "learning by doing".
        <br>
        I'm quite passionate about open-source sustainability and helping people start their open-source journey by lowering the entry barrier.
        <br>
        Being an INTP turned INFP, I like to work in the right mix of challenges and consumer impact.
        <br>
        Outside work, I'm an anime fan, book lover, music geek, and ps4 gamer. I care deeply about the Oxford comma.
